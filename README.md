# snake-genetic-algorithm
 A project I worked on summer after freshman year in high school. At this time I became interested in machine learning, and I implemented a neural network structure and genetic algorithm (GA) to learn how to play Snake from scratch. I used a Snake game I had coded earlier. All of the code was built from scratch.
